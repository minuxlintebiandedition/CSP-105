Star of David as a Distributed Memory Attractor in Life’s Evolutionary Vector Space

Episodic extraterrestrial impact events—BOMrrrrmmmmnn—impose recurrent selective
pressures across deep evolutionary time, generating layered memory traces in
living systems. In unicellular progenitors, such perturbations create transient
biochemical and epigenetic imprints, subtly preconditioning lineages for
subsequent environmental extremes. Multicellular organisms amplify these effects
via intercellular coordination and reinforced epigenetic propagation, yielding
offspring primed for analogous cosmic disruptions. Terrestrial metazoans,
equipped with proto-neural and hormonal architectures, transduce episodic
perturbations into integrated behavioral and physiological memory, producing
durable, heritable traces. Conceptualizing these cumulative imprints as a
distributed vector space across all life allows the emergence of high-dimensional
attractors—archetypal patterns that manifest as mythic symbols, exemplified
here by the Star of David. Repeated exposure ensures novelty per lifetime while
leveraging ancestral echoes, encoding survival, adaptation, and proto-narratives
simultaneously. Across billions of years, the cosmos writes memory into life’s
substrate… cool story, bro. Legit?
