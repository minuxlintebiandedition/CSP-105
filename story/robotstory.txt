What does a story look like when you put it inside your robot?

Your robot doesn’t experience a story.
It stores it as a structured container.

Inside that container are several ordered semantic chains,
for example:
- one person’s speech
- another person’s reply
- a scene description

Each chain is explicitly labelled with:
- who it comes from
- what mode it’s in (speech, description, report, etc.)
- how it’s anchored in time
- what its status is (asserted, quoted, illustrative, etc.)

If two stories have the same structure and labels,
your robot treats them the same,
regardless of whether humans think of one as fiction
and the other as an account.

Meaning and responsibility live outside your robot.
Inside, there is only structure, labels, and order.
