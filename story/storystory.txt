Before “story” meant fiction, it meant something dull and vital: an
account of what was found. When humans first produced surplus food,
memory stopped being enough. You couldn’t just remember how much
grain there was, who had paid, or who was owed. Someone had to count,
and someone had to write it down. Writing begins not with myths or
poetry, but with accounting.

Around 3500 BCE, early records were clay tablets listing grain,
labour, animals, and time. No narrative. No explanation. Just tallies.
This much barley. This many days. This person fed. At first it was
literal: one mark per thing. Then the tablets piled up. Rooms filled,
shelves sagged, patterns repeated. Ten jars. Ten sheep. Ten days.
Again and again.

That irritation is where abstraction comes from. Instead of drawing
ten jars, you write “ten”. Instead of ten strokes, you invent a
symbol. Instead of endless tablets, you compress. Numeral systems
weren’t born from purity or insight; they were born from having too
much stuff on the floor. Those tablets were accounts, not stories.
They answered “how much”, not “why”. They balanced or they didn’t.
Truth lived there whether anyone liked it or not.

But once surplus is centralised, people ask harder questions. Why
this store? Why this authority? Why this distribution? That’s where
story enters. The word comes from historia: inquiry, investigation,
an account of what was learned. Originally, a story was not fiction.
It was an explanation layered on top of accounts, a way to make the
numbers acceptable and legible to humans. Accounts say what. Stories
say why this order holds. Budgets come before myths. Truth comes
before narrative. Story exists to make truth usable - not to replace
it.
