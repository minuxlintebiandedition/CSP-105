MODULE Logic {

// COMMON FAILURE MODES WHEN CONFLATED

FAILURE CategoryError {
    cause: Treating speech acts as formal proofs

}

FAILURE Equivocation {
    cause: Term meaning shifts unnoticed
    symptom: Conclusions appear derived but rest on drift

FAILURE RhetoricAsProof {
    cause: Persuasive fluency mistaken for inference
    symptom: Confidence substituted for validity

The structured version above is not a translation, explanation, or formalisation of the human version below; they are deliberately non-equivalent views intended to expose the failure that occurs when logic is mistaken for meaning.

LOGIC vs SPEECH / MEANING

LOGIC
- A formal system of symbols and rules.
- Operates on structure, not content.
- Cares about validity: if premises are true, does the conclusion follow?
- Blind to context, intent, tone, culture, or consequence.
- Does not know what words mean; only how symbols relate.

SPEECH / MEANING
- Natural language used by humans.
- Operates on meaning, context, and shared assumptions.
- Cares about effect: what is understood, implied, or persuaded.
- Allows ambiguity, metaphor, irony, and drift.
- Meaning changes with speaker, listener, and situation.

WHAT GOES WRONG WHEN THEY ARE CONFLATED

CATEGORY ERROR
- Treating fluent speech as if it were formal proof.
- “It sounds logical” is mistaken for “it is valid”.

SEMANTIC DRIFT
- Words quietly change meaning mid-argument.
- Conclusions appear derived but rest on unstable terms.

RHETORIC AS PROOF
- Persuasion, confidence, or elegance replaces inference.
- Agreement is produced without justification.

FALSE OBJECTIVITY
- Disagreement is labeled “illogical” when it is really about meaning,
  values, or unshared assumptions.

AI FAILURE MODE
- Fluent language output is mistaken for reasoning.
- Coherence is over-trusted as correctness.

CORRECTIVE DISCIPLINE

Ask three separate questions, in order:
1. Is the inference structurally valid?        (logic)
2. Are the terms stable and shared?             (semantics)
3. What is being done with the speech act?      (pragmatics)

RULES TO KEEP DISTINCT

- Logic is not meaning.
- Validity is not truth.
- Coherence is not correctness.
- Speech can suggest without proving.

NOTES / MISREADINGS TO AVOID

- This page does not present a proof.
- It does not formalise meaning.
- It does not make speech logical, nor logic meaningful.

- The structured form is not “more correct” than the human form.
- The human form is not a simplification of the structured form.
- Each can reveal failures the other cannot.

- If you treat fluency as validity, you are committing the error described here.
- If you treat structure as authority, you are committing the error described here.
- If you treat disagreement as illogic, you are committing the error described here.
