Every cat, every cat, what have you been eating?

We keep reaching for the language of competition and apex because it feels explanatory.
It gives us winners, losers, hierarchies, and a sense of inevitability.

But it quietly breaks reality.

It freezes motion.
It turns moments into identities.
It mistakes temporary maxima for permanent roles.
And from that mistake, moral justifications leak in:
entitlement, dominance, inevitability, “deserving” to be on top.

We attempt to fix that error without denying competition,
and without pretending there is no apex.


THE MOVING APEX AS EIGENMODE

People often argue about competition as if it explains everything.
Who wins, who loses, who’s on top.
Apex predators, dominant strategies, survival of the fittest.

It sounds hard-headed.
But something about it never quite fits lived reality.

Because when you actually watch the world, nothing sits still long enough
to deserve a crown.

At any given moment, there *is* an apex.
That much is unavoidable.
If food, energy, attention, or opportunity is flowing,
then somewhere those flows resolve most strongly.
By definition, there is a maximum.

But that apex is not a thing.
It is not a role.
It is not an identity.
It is not even reliably an animal.

The apex is the sum of all won competitions,
averaged over all food events.

Most of those competitions are tiny and unromantic.
Being slightly closer.
Being awake.
Being warm.
Being already there.
A leaf catching light before another leaf shades it.
A cat intercepting movement a human just created by standing up.
A fox benefiting from panic it didn’t cause.
A grub inheriting the consequences of all of them.

No one announces these wins.
No one keeps score.
But they accumulate.

And when you average them over time,
you get something that *looks* like dominance
if you freeze the frame.


WHERE WE GO WRONG

The mistake is not saying “there is an apex”.
The mistake is forgetting the averaging,
and mistaking a moving solution for a stable property.

We talk as if some animals *are* apex.
As if humans *are* apex.
As if apexhood is something you can own.

From there, moral fantasy enters:
justification,
entitlement,
inevitability.

But the apex cannot teleport.
It has inertia.
It roves.

It follows gradients.
Calories.
Motion.
Heat.
Vulnerability.
Attention.
Opportunity.

One minute it might resolve on you —
crumbs, warmth, stillness, awareness.
Then it slides to your cat.
Then to a squirrel.
Then to a fox.
Then into the soil as grubs.
Then back up as birds.

Nothing is handed over.
Nothing is crowned.
The convergence just keeps moving.


WHY PYRAMIDS FAIL

Pyramids assume rest.
Static food webs do too.
They hang relationships in space and pretend motion is a detail.

But the biosphere is not a structure.
It is an edible wave complex:
moving,
interfering,
folding back on itself,
constantly consuming and being consumed.

Competition still exists here.
It just stops doing moral work.
It becomes bookkeeping —
one flow captured instead of another —
not a story about who deserves to win.


THE RESULT

There is always an apex.
There is never *the* apex.

Apexhood is a moving average,
not a crown.

Animals appear there often
because they are dense, mobile, responsive shapes
that temporarily hold convergence well.

But nothing owns it.
Nothing keeps it.
Nothing deserves it.

Once you let the apex move,
a lot of bad questions disappear.

And the world starts behaving
exactly like the one you were already living in,
just without the lies we used to keep it still.
