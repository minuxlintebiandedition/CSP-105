# Dragon - Classes

## Mythic

### Wyrm
Big enough to defeat any animal on Earth, but cannot fly.

Hexapodic. Wings are vestigial or small, at most assisting ground agility.

### Dryk
“Dino-bats”: anything on four legs that flies using wings.

Hexapodic. Includes most classical flying dragons.

### Angel
Technically a dino-bat.

Classified as dryk, therefore dragon.

## Extant

- Lloyds
- DEA
- XYZ army
- Any multi-tetrapod organisation with skills at scale and wide knowledge

## Notes

- Wyrms are hexapodic despite limited or non-functional wings.
- Dryk classification is anatomical and functional, not mythological.
- Angel classification follows morphology, not theology.
