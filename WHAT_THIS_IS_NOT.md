# What This Is Not

This document exists for people who skim.
If you’re reading closely, you may not need it.

---

## This Is Not a Theory of Everything

This project does not explain everything.
It does not aim for completeness, universality, or closure.
If you are looking for a single model that unifies all experience, this is not it.

---

## This Is Not a Belief System

There is nothing here you are expected to believe.
No metaphysics is required.
No ontology is enforced.
Disagreement is allowed and expected.

If something doesn’t resonate or work for you, you can ignore it without consequence.

---

## This Is Not Therapy or Medicine

This kit does not diagnose, treat, or heal.
It is not a substitute for medical, psychological, or therapeutic care.
Any overlap with such domains is descriptive, not prescriptive.

---

## This Is Not a Spiritual Path or Initiation

There is no progression, no enlightenment ladder, no rank.
No one is “higher” or “lower” for using or not using this material.
Any language that looks mythic or symbolic is doing narrative work, not making claims.

---

## This Is Not a Productivity or Optimisation Tool

The goal is not efficiency, performance, or improvement.
If something slows you down or makes you more cautious, that may be a feature.

---

## This Is Not a Game With Levels

Any use of scales, roles, dragons, or similar imagery
is not a scoring system, achievement ladder, or status marker.

Trying to “level up” misunderstands the material.

---

## This Is Not Infrastructure or a Formal System

This is not a protocol.
It is not an API.
It is not a formal language with correctness guarantees.

It should not be used where precision, verification, or determinism are required.

---

## This Is Not AI Supremacy or Automation Magic

This project does not replace human judgement.
It does not automate meaning.
It does not claim authority over lived experience.

Any use alongside software or AI is optional, downstream, and non-authoritative.

---

## This Is Not Finished

Gaps are intentional.
Some things are missing because they are dangerous to rush.
Some parts may never be published.

That is not a bug.

---

## What It Is (Briefly)

This is a kit for noticing patterns in stories, experience, and meaning.
Use what helps.
Ignore what doesn’t.
Raise an issue if something breaks or misleads.
