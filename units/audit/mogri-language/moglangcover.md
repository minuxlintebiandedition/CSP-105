Mogri Language Audit — Coverage Summary
--------------------------------------

Purpose
-------
This document summarises the scope and coverage of the Mogri Language
Audit, including population reach and outcome distribution.

Scope
-----
- Individual audit files created: ~63 languages
- Language selection prioritised by:
  - number of native speakers (L1)
  - widespread second-language use (L2)
  - representation across language families and typologies

Population Coverage
-------------------

Estimated global population: ~8.1 billion

Coverage achieved:
- Languages audited directly: ~63
- Estimated population covered (L1 + major L2): >99%

Remaining populations not directly audited are overwhelmingly bilingual
or multilingual in already-covered languages.

Outcome Categories
------------------

Languages fall into three outcome classes:

1) Mogri latent
   - Morphological or syntactic affordances exist
   - Lexical expansion historically constrained
   - Example: English

2) Still missing mogri
   - No native neutral carrier
   - No strong structural objection to lexicalisation
   - Absence recorded descriptively

3) Lexicalisation discouraged
   - Introducing a carrier would reduce clarity or fidelity
   - Existing systems already handle persistence-through-change
   - Absence is a positive, stable outcome

Approximate Breakdown
---------------------

By number of audited languages:

- Mogri latent:        1
- Still missing:       ~25
- Lexicalisation discouraged: ~37

By population coverage (approximate):

- Mogri latent:        ~18% (English L1 + L2 reach)
- Still missing:       ~30–35%
- Lexicalisation discouraged: ~45–50%

Notes
-----
Percentages are approximate and depend on L2 weighting.
Exact precision is neither possible nor necessary for semantic audits.

Conclusion
----------
The audit demonstrates that:
- absence of a neutral persistence-through-change carrier is the norm
- languages compensate via diverse structural strategies
- no known language provides a clean counterexample

The sample is saturated.
