RabbinicHebrew-Mogri-Audit.txt
=============================

Language: Rabbinic Hebrew
ISO code: he (historical register)
Native speakers consulted: legal / scholarly tradition
Date: 2026-01

Register scope:
- legal
- philosophical
- scholarly

CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Rabbinic Hebrew lexicalise persistence-through-change neutrally?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- הוויה (havayah)
- שינוי (shinui)
- נעשה (na'aseh)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- havayah is abstract and technical
- shinui implies alteration
- na'aseh implies becoming-done
- all are embedded in legal-metaphysical systems

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- legal reasoning chains
- case-based abstraction
- layered commentary

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
High (discursive expansion)

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

NOTES
-----
Rabbinic Hebrew systematises change through law and discourse,
not via a neutral carrier.

STATUS
------
☑ Still missing mogri
☑ Lexicalisation discouraged
