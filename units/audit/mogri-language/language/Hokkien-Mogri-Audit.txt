CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Min Nan lexicalise persistence-through-change neutrally?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- 變 (piàn)

- 化 (hòa)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------

- aspect and particles carry most meaning
- no neutral carrier independent of context

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD

- serial verb constructions
- discourse context

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
Low
