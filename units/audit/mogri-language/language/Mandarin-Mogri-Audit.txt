Mandarin-Mogri-Audit.txt
=======================

Language: Mandarin Chinese
ISO code: zh
Native speakers consulted: contextual usage
Date: 2026-01

Register scope:
- everyday
- literary

CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Mandarin lexicalise persistence-through-change as a single carrier?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- 变 (biàn)
- 成为 (chéngwéi)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- biàn implies a change event
- chéngwéi implies becoming-into
- meaning depends on context rather than a carrier

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- aspect particles
- serial verbs
- omission and contextual inference

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
Medium (distributed across context)

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

NOTES
-----
Mandarin resists lexical pinning; forcing mogri would over-specify.

STATUS
------
☑ Still missing mogri
☑ Lexicalisation discouraged
