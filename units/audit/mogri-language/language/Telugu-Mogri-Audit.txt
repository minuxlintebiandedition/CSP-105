CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Telugu lexicalise persistence-through-change neutrally?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- అవ్వడం (avvaḍam)
- మారడం (māraḍam)

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- avvaḍam implies becoming-into
- māraḍam implies change
- verbs encode transition rather than persistence

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD

- aspectual suffixes
- auxiliary verbs
- narrative framing

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no
