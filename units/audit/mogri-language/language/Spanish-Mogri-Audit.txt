Spanish-Mogri-Audit.txt
======================

Language: Spanish
ISO code: es
Native speakers consulted: everyday + philosophical usage
Date: 2026-01

Register scope:
- everyday
- literary
- philosophical

CORE QUESTION
-------------
Does Spanish have a single neutral lexical carrier for persistence-through-change?

CANDIDATE TERMS
---------------
- devenir
- volverse
- transformarse
- convertirse

WHY THEY FAIL
-------------
- devenir is literary and directional
- volverse implies a change of state
- transformarse implies an operation
- convertirse implies becoming-into an identity

COMMON WORKAROUNDS USED INSTEAD
-------------------------------
- reflexive constructions
- periphrastic verb forms
- aspectual markers
- metaphor (process, flow)

COST OF WORKAROUND
------------------
High (verbosity and paraphrase)

VERDICT
-------
Mogri present? no

NOTES
-----
Spanish relies heavily on periphrasis and reflexivity to keep change
alive without freezing it.

STATUS
------
☑ Still missing mogri
