# CSP‑105 (Complete Semantic Primes - 105 items - complete list for modelling)

**CSP‑105** is a semantic primes framework for representing complex concepts as interconnected nodes. It provides a minimal, structured vocabulary to capture meaning, enabling reasoning, visualization, and reuse of abstract ideas across multiple domains.

---

## Overview

CSP‑105 defines a set of **core semantic nodes (primes)** and relationships between them, forming a structured, machine-readable network of concepts. It is designed for:

- Semantic modeling and knowledge representation  
- Abstract reasoning and conceptual analysis  
- Interdisciplinary reuse of conceptual primitives

## FAQ

# Terminology Note # 
Throughout these files, we use the term **“semantic primitives”** instead of “primes.”  
This is intentional: the word *prime* is highly fundamental and can interfere with AI reasoning if used too closely to content, potentially causing unintended associations. Using “semantic primitives” keeps the conceptual framework clear and avoids proximity-based confusion.

# CSP-105 Mini-Prompt #

Map all concepts to the 105 **semantic primitives**.  
Do not invent new concepts or unstated assumptions.  
Highlight missing primitives rather than filling gaps.  
Maintain consistency and avoid drifting meanings.
