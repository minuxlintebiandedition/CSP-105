1) so if transmogrification is the inexplicable transformation, mogrification is the inexplicability of existence itself in motion?
2) can we factor out the -ification and ask what is mogri?
3) mogri map? mogriness? mograte? mogristic? mogriantic?
4) no, mog is not the root, mogri is the root, out damn spot and i don't care if are a cat!
5) Do not explain mogri yet, test only whether the root behaves like a general placeholder rather than a definition.
